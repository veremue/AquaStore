The Challenge

Buiding API that can keep track of the stock for AquaStore, a pet fish store. The store boasts a number of different types of aquariums, each holding a certain number and type of fish.

Model
There are only two concepts involved in this aquatic world:
Aquariums: They can vary in glass type, size (litres), and shape.
Fish: They can vary in species, color, and number of fins. Think of a few but at least have a goldfish and a guppy.

There are also some rules:
Goldfish can't go in the same aquarium as guppies.
Fish with three fins or more don't go in aquariums of 75 litres or less.

API endpoints
Now, AquaStore wants to have an application to keep track of all of its aquariums and their fish by having access to two endpoints:
One to create or update a fish
One to retrieve all fish for a given aquarium.

Bonus
If you want to go out of your way and flex those dev skills, we would like you to take into account that AquaStore is considering opening a store in the US. That means theyâ€™ll have to be able to convert their aquarium size from litres to gallons.
